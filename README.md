# predicting-employee-turnover

Summary
The objective of this project is to predict employee turnover using historical employee data. The dataset used for this project includes employee demographic data, job performance data, and turnover status data. The project involves several steps, including data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model building and evaluation, and deployment. The project is implemented in Python using various data science libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and XGBoost. The final model achieved an accuracy of 84% in predicting employee turnover.

Technology Used
Python: The project is implemented in Python, which is a popular programming language for data science and machine learning.

Pandas: Pandas is a Python library used for data manipulation and analysis.

NumPy: NumPy is a Python library used for numerical computing and array manipulation.

Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a Python library used for machine learning and data mining.

XGBoost: XGBoost is a Python library used for building and training gradient boosting models.

Jupyter Notebook: Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application used for interactive computing and data analysis.

Dataset:
The dataset used for this project includes employee demographic data, job performance data, and turnover status data. The dataset contains the following features:

Age: Age of the employee.
Attrition: Whether the employee has left the company or not.
BusinessTravel: Frequency of business travel for the employee.
DailyRate: Daily rate of pay for the employee.
Department: Department in which the employee works.
DistanceFromHome: Distance from home to work for the employee.
Education: Education level of the employee.
EducationField: Field of education for the employee.
EmployeeCount: Number of employees.
EmployeeNumber: Unique identifier for each employee.
EnvironmentSatisfaction: Level of satisfaction with the work environment.
Gender: Gender of the employee.
HourlyRate: Hourly rate of pay for the employee.
JobInvolvement: Level of involvement in the job.
JobLevel: Level of the employee's job.
JobRole: Role of the employee in the company.
JobSatisfaction: Level of job satisfaction reported by the employee.
MaritalStatus: Marital status of the employee.
MonthlyIncome: Monthly income of the employee.
MonthlyRate: Monthly rate of pay for the employee.
NumCompaniesWorked: Number of companies the employee has worked for.
Over18: Whether the employee is over 18 years old or not.
OverTime: Whether the employee works overtime or not.
PercentSalaryHike: Percentage increase in salary for the employee.
PerformanceRating: Employee's job performance rating.
RelationshipSatisfaction: Level of satisfaction with relationships at work.
StandardHours: Standard number of hours worked by the employee.
StockOptionLevel: Level of stock options granted to the employee.
TotalWorkingYears: Total number of years the employee has worked.
TrainingTimesLastYear: Number of training sessions attended by the employee last year.
WorkLifeBalance: Level of work-life balance reported by the employee.
YearsAtCompany: Number of years the employee has worked at the company.
YearsInCurrentRole: Number of years the employee has worked in the current role.
YearsSinceLastPromotion: Number of years since the employee's last promotion.
YearsWithCurrManager: Number of years the employee has worked with the current manager.

Insights:

After exploring and analyzing the data, several insights were discovered:

Employees who are younger, have lower job satisfaction, have lower performance ratings, and have worked for fewer years at the company are more likely to leave.

Employees who work overtime are more likely to leave.

The most important features for predicting employee turnover are age, job satisfaction, and years at the company.

The XGBoost model achieved an accuracy of 84% in predicting employee turnover.

The model can be used to identify employees who are at high risk of leaving the company and take proactive measures to retain them.


Why the Project Works:

This project works because it demonstrates the power of data science and machine learning in predicting employee turnover and identifying opportunities for retention. By analyzing employee demographic and job performance data, the project provides valuable insights into the factors that influence employee turnover and the types of employees who are most likely to leave the company. The predictive model developed using XGBoost enables the human resources department to identify high-risk employees and take proactive measures to retain them, such as offering training and development opportunities, adjusting compensation and benefits packages, or improving work-life balance. Overall, this project showcases the value of data-driven decision making in improving employee engagement and retention
